! Reference frame - convention:
! ----------------------------
!
! The code uses the following convention for the reference frame:
!
!  - X axis is East
!  - Y axis is North
!  - Z axis is up
!
! Note that this convention is different from both the Aki-Richards convention
! and the Harvard CMT convention.
!
! Let us recall that the Aki-Richards convention is:
!
!  - X axis is North
!  - Y axis is East
!  - Z axis is down
!
! and that the Harvard CMT convention is:
!
!  - X axis is South
!  - Y axis is East
!  - Z axis is up

! Evolution of the code:
! ---------------------
!
! MPI v. 2.1, July 2012:
! Max Rietmann, Peter Messmer, Daniel Peter, Dimitri Komatitsch, Joseph Charles, Zhinan Xie:
! support for CUDA GPUs, better CFL stability for the Stacey absorbing conditions.

! MPI v. 2.0, November 2010:
! Dimitri Komatitsch, Nicolas Le Goff, Roland Martin and Pieyre Le Loher, University of Pau, France,
! Daniel Peter, Jeroen Tromp and the Princeton group of developers, Princeton University, USA,
! and Emanuele Casarotti, INGV Roma, Italy:
!  support for CUBIT meshes decomposed by SCOTCH;
!  much faster solver using Michel Deville's inlined matrix products.
!
! MPI v. 1.4 Dimitri Komatitsch, University of Pau, Qinya Liu and others, Caltech, September 2006:
!  better adjoint and kernel calculations, faster and better I/Os
!  on very large systems, many small improvements and bug fixes
!
! MPI v. 1.3 Dimitri Komatitsch, University of Pau, and Qinya Liu, Caltech, July 2005:
!  serial version, regular mesh, adjoint and kernel calculations, ParaView support
!

!  of Vs with depth, Hauksson's regional model, attenuation, oceans, movies
!
! MPI v. 1.0 Dimitri Komatitsch, Caltech, USA, May 2002: first MPI version based on global code
!
! Dimitri Komatitsch, IPG Paris, France, December 1996: first 3-D solver for the CM-5 Connection Machine,
!    parallelized on 128 processors using Connection Machine Fortran
!

! in case of an acoustic medium, a potential Chi of (density * displacement) is used as in Chaljub and Valette,
! Geophysical Journal International, vol. 158, p. 131-141 (2004) and *NOT* a velocity potential
! as in Komatitsch and Tromp, Geophysical Journal International, vol. 150, p. 303-318 (2002).
!
! This permits acoustic-elastic coupling based on a non-iterative time scheme.
! Displacement is then:
!     u = grad(Chi) / rho
! Velocity is then:
!     v = grad(Chi_dot) / rho
! (Chi_dot being the time derivative of Chi)
! and pressure is:
!     p = - Chi_dot_dot
! (Chi_dot_dot being the time second derivative of Chi).
!
! The source in an acoustic element is a pressure source.
!
! First-order acoustic-acoustic discontinuities are also handled automatically
! because pressure is continuous at such an interface, therefore Chi_dot_dot
! is continuous, therefore Chi is also continuous, which is consistent with
! the spectral-element basis functions and with the assembling process.
! This is the reason why a simple displacement potential u = grad(Chi) would
! not work because it would be discontinuous at such an interface and would
! therefore not be consistent with the basis functions.
